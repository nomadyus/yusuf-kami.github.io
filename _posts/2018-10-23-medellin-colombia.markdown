Today I'm writing from Medellin, Colombia a very beautiful city indeed. I checked into the place I'm staying at 00:08 this morning. The kind clerk, who I can't belive had to work that late, showed me to my room after the check-in was completed and I immediately passed out on the bed prepeared for me. I remember while the clerk showed me into the shred bedroom one of the guests that was sleeping mouthes some words under her breath; I believe it was something like "turn off the lights" in spanish even though I don't know the language.

(I took a video of me walking around the block of the hostel I was staying at[Calle 11a WALK video])
