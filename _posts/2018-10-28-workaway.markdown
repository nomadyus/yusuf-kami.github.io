While getting something to drink from the fridge at the Hostel I met another guest that asked if I was a volunteer. It turns out he is another Canadian from Vancouver (and Montreal)! I learned that I can work as a volunteer at the Hostel, which I will speak to the Manager about. He also directed me to www.workaway.info where I can volunteer in places around the world with free boarding and food. Of course I jumped directly on this and registered an account. This will be another path to enable me to travel the world.

See you in the future!
