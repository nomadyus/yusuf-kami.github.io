I had an interesting dream today, and it ignited my sleeping passion for creativity again. I say "again" because my passions usually waxes and wanes like the moon as there are too many goals I need to accomplish.

But the passion this time focuses on creating short comedy videos that I can share on any media platforms. I've been inspired by the "flipping-and-staking" skit by McPhonz and every time I watch it I realized how amazingly simple and classic it is.

I need to start making videos like that, simple yet classically funny. Watch out for the videos I will be making.

See you in the future and remember, there is always room at the top!
