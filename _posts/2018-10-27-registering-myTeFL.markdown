Still in Medellin, Colombia and it's been a amazing everyday here. So I've been thinking lately of continuing my travels indefinitely! Here are my thoughts and concerns on the matter:

I want to travel the world busting out of the corporate grind (and greed) that abounds in North America. But I'm aware of the cost of travelling the world so it is beneficial to have some sort of paying vocation while I travel. I can still provide my software development skills from anywhere around the world (take that Chemical Engineering degree) so that should afford me some peace of mind.

Another path I have started working is obtaining a TEFL certificate so I can teach English in various locations around the world. I have registered and started working on the certificate through myTEFL. It will take me 120 hours to get the required certificate so I can start teaching immediately.

One problem with teaching abroad with myTEFL is it requires one whole year of working at the specified location,  with or without boarding. I believe the teaching schedule will likely be 6 -  8 hours a day so I will have to properly plan my time for my creative endeavors and my software development work.

Hope this all works out.

See you in the future!
